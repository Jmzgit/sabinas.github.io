<h1 style="text-align:center;">Get Rhythm by Johnny Cash</h1><p>

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones<p>
Put taps on your toes and get gone<p>
Get rhythm when you get the blues.<p><p><p>

A Little shoeshine boy he never gets low down<p>
But he's got the dirtiest job in town<p>
Bending low at the peoples feet<p>
On the windy corner of the dirty street<p>
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes<p>
How'd he keep from getting the blues<p>
He grinned as he raised his little head<p>
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said<p>


Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine<p>
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind<p>
Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>


Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones<p>
Put taps on your toes and get gone<p>
Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy<p>
And I thought I was going to jump for joy<p>
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right<p>
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight<p>
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away<p>
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way<p>
He said I like it with a big wide grin<p>
Kept on a popping and he said again<p>

Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe<p>
Does a million dollars worth of good for you<p><p>
Get rhythm when you get the blues<p><p>

Compositores: Johnny R. Cash
