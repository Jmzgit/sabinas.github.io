<h1 style="text-align:center;">Get Rhythm by Johnny Cash</h1><p>

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine<p>
it'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,<p>
get rhythm when you get the blues.<p><p><p>

Little shoeshine boy never get slow down<p>
but he's gt the dirtiest job in town<p>
bendin' low at the peoples' feet<p>
on the windy corner of the dirty street<p>
well, i asked him while he shined my shoes<p>
how'd he keep from gettin' the blues<p>
he grinned as he raised his little head<p>
popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.<p><p><p>


Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
it only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe<p>
does a million dollars worth of good for you<p>
get rhythm when you get thee blues.<p><p><p>


Well, i sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy<p>
and i thought i was gonna jump for joy<p>
slapped on the shoe polish left and right<p>
he took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight<p>
he stopped once to wipe the sweat away<p>
i said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way<p>
he said i like it with a big wide grin<p>
kept on a poppin' and he said again<p><p><p>

Get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
hey, get rhythm when you get the blues<p>
get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones<p>
get taps on your toes and get gone<p>
get rhythm when you get the blues.<p><p>


Compositores: Johnny R. Cash
